## Travelling and storing memories on an app

#### *Sebastian Tenorio*

For this term project, I want to design an application that will be able to store
information about places/countries for people **who travel**. I want my application
to have a map of the world so that users can add a pin to a country they want
to visit, or that they will visit. I want users to be able to:

- Add important information about the kind of places they want to visit when they get to X country
- Add events they might want to attend during their visit
- Add pictures of them at specific landmarks
- Be able to rate the countries they visit

I have always had the opportunity to travel abroad since I was very young, and I feel
like having an application that could do the things I am proposing for my app
would have been very useful as well as a very nice way to store those travelling memories.

### User Stories

In the context of my travelling application:
- As a user, I want to be able to add multiple countries to my list of places I
  want to / will visit
- As a user, I want to be able to add a place I want to visit in that country
- As a user, I want to be able to rate the country according to my visit
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a country from the list of countries
- As a user, I want to be able to save my list of countries if I want to
- As a user, when I start the application, I want to be given the option to load my list of countries from file.
