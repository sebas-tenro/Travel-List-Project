# 🌍 Travel Memories App
#### A personal/academic project by Sebastian Tenorio
A lightweight travel-planning and memory-tracking application where users can pin countries on a world map, store meaningful trip information, and keep a record of places they’ve visited or plan to visit. Designed as part of an academic project, this app showcases data modeling, user-driven design, and file-based persistence.
### ✨ Overview
The Travel Memories App helps travelers organize and preserve details about their trips. Users can build a personalized world map filled with:
 - Countries they want to visit or have already visited
 - Places and attractions they plan to explore
 - Events during their trips
 - Personal ratings for each country
 - Photo memories associated with specific locations
This project is inspired by my long-standing passion for travel and the desire to keep a meaningful digital record of the experiences and places that have shaped my journey.

### 🚀 Key Features
- World Map Interaction
   - Add a country to your travel list
   - View and manage all saved destinations
- Country Details, users can store:
   - Points of interest they want to visit
   - Events or activities
   - Personal notes
   - Ratings after visiting

### 💾 Data Persistence
- Save your entire travel list to a file
- Reload your saved data when restarting the application
- Supports JSON-based serialization (inspired by the JsonSerializationDemo project)

### 👤 User Stories
1. As a user, I want to add multiple countries I plan to visit.
2. As a user, I want to add places of interest within each country.
3. As a user, I want to rate countries after visiting them.

6. As a user, when I start the application, I want to choose whether to load previously saved data.

### 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts
This project highlights experience with:
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- JSON serialization & file I/O
- Model–View–Controller (MVC) architecture (if relevant — let me know and I will include it)
- User-centered design & feature planning
- Data modeling for nested, real-world entities
